#What is this?
A quick stab at Genetic Algorithm, implemented in Go.

Tried my best to make it as genetic as possible. It is quite difficult
with Go since Interface << Inheritance (controversial, yes).

It is `v0.1`. Zero unit testing, just a sample code in `main.go`.

I feel sad that even after trying my best to make it as generic as possible, it stills required
nearly ~100 lines of code to use the library for a trivial problem (take a look at numeric_sum.go).

#Ok what's next?
My goal is to provide a better, dumb down interface for the users.
This will require some knowledge in good software design, which I might
or might not have :(.

#Ok it's a WIP, how to use?
See `numeric_sum.go`.
